title: Publicancreators
summary: Program for controlling Publican
description: PublicanCreators are a small tool for daily DocBook writers who are using
  the Redhat publican tool [https://fedorahosted.org/publican/]. PublicanCreators
  asks after launching which title, type and environment should be used. Then it starts
  publican with that settings and works then with the produced files. It will work
  inside the Article_Info.xml, Book_Info.xml, TITLE.ent, Author_Group.xml and Revision_History.xml
  and will replace the default values with your name, you company, your company_divison
  and your private or your business email address, depending on your chosen environment.
  Also you can set inside your config fil that you want to remove the Title Logo or
  the Legal Notice. As a feature it ships a build script for each project.
