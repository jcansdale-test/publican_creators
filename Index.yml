summary: A program for creating an application

description:
  PublicanCreators are a small tool for daily DocBook writers who are using the Redhat publican tool https://fedorahosted.org/publican/. PublicanCreators asks after
  launching which title, type and environment should be used. Then it starts publican with that settings and works then with the produced files.
  It will work inside the Article_Info.xml, Book_Info.xml, TITLE.ent, Author_Group.xml and Revision_History.xml and
  will replace the default values with your name, your company, your company_divison and your private or your business
  email address, depending on your chosen environment. Also you can set inside your config file that you want to remove
  the Title Logo or the Legal Notice. As a feature it ships a build script for each project.
