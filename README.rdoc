== Description

PublicanCreators are a small tool for daily DocBook writers who are using the Redhat publican tool [https://fedorahosted.org/publican/]. PublicanCreators asks after
launching which title, type and environment should be used. Then it starts publican with that settings and works then with the produced files. So it adds the users
information in the Article_Info, Revision_History and so on.
You can write your own settings in the Configurations file.

== Installation

The installation is very easy.

    gem install PublicanCreators
    bin/setup.sh

If you are updated to a newer gem just run:

    bin/update.sh

== Hard dependencies
* yad
* publican (a 4.x version is needed)

== Soft dependencies
I'm using:

* dir
* fileutils
* nokogiri

Bundler should solve the dependencies by itself.

== Usage

    bin/PublicanCreators.rb

Or just use the Launcher.
