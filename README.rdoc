== DESCRIPTION:

publican_creators are a small tool for daily DocBook writers who are using the Redhat publican tool
https://fedorahosted.org/publican/. publican_creators asks after launching which title, type and environment should be
used. Then it starts publican with that settings and works then with the produced files.
It will work on the Article_Info.xml, Book_Info.xml, TITLE.ent, Author_Group.xml and Revision_History.xml and
will replace the default values with your name, your company, your company_divison and your private or your business
email address, depending on your chosen environment. Also, you can set your config file that you want to remove
the Title Logo or the Legal Notice. As a feature, it ships a build script for each project.

The History.rdoc contains a detailed description of what has changed. For most
users the NEWS file might be a better place to look since it contains
change summaries between the different versions.

This Gem was programmed and tested on Linux systems. If anyone would like to make the methods also fit for other OS,
I'm happy about Pull requests.

* parseconfig
* rainbow

== INSTALL:

The installation is very easy.

    gem install publican_creators
    cd /path/to/gem (In case of using RVM ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-$RUBYVERSION/gems/publican_creators)
    rake

You have to run the setup after each gem update.
